### Coffe and Coding 
<br />
Having a cup of coffee is something I enjoy every day, and I believe it is typical for an average graduate student and almost a life source. Coffee helps wake up in the morning and can be used as a pill for concentration or getting some coffee while you are spending time with people during break hours or leisure. What about people who do coding? Many graduate students drink coffee while coding because coffee contains caffeine and keeps your brain from getting tiresome. Here, the coffee and code dataset from Kaggle has nine columns, including coding hours, coffee cups per day, coffee time, coding without coffee, coffee type, solve bugs, country, age range, and gender.

### Dataset
I found the dataset from Kaggle, and it is the "caffeine content of drinks" and "Coffee and code dataset"
